1. Who is the key user? This isn't always clear, especially in marketplace sites, so take your best guess.

2. What is that user's number one critical goal when using the site? Be as specific as possible if there are multiple options here, e.g. "to purchase a red wagon" instead of "buy a toy".

3. What is likely to make that user's experience particularly positive (i.e. provide good satisfaction)?

4. What is the approximate information architecture of the site? (sketch it out)

5. What is the flow through that architecture for the user who is accomplishing the critical goal you identified above?

6. What style(s) of navigation is/are used? Do they answer the two key questions (Where am I and how did I get here? Where should I go next and how do I get there?)?

7. What key interactions does the user have? Are they clear and usable?

8. What did the site do well to allow the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?

9. What did the site do poorly when allowing the user to accomplish his goal effectively, efficiently and with good satisfaction?

Adding Design

1. Open your eyes and ask yourself "who is the user?"

2. What is the user's critical goal? (or at least what do you think the site owner wants them to do?)

3. Does the visual hierarchy you sketched lead to that goal?

4. What font families are most prominent on the site? (use the WhatFont add-on or your browser's developer tools to inspect this).

5. How do these font families contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

6. How do the line spacings, sizes, colors and weights contribute to or take away from the site's flow?

7. What would you improve to achieve a better hierarchy or flow?
